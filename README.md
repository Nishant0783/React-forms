<h1>Basics to Advanced React Login and Authentication.</h1>
<hr>

<p>As an intermediate react developer, I have dived into intermediate to advanced frontend login and authentication system. <br> This repo breaks down the project into 9 lectures where each lecture has something new to learn. <br> Below is the detailed learning from each lecture.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 01</h3>
<p>This lecture covers the fundamentals of creating a Registratrion form. With the use of aria attributes with the input fields, I have created a form which is accessible to the people with disabilities. Also, I have used "useRef" hook from react to focus on the different inputs and errros accordingly.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 02</h3>
<p>This lecture covers the fundamentals for creating a Login form with the use of aria attributes and semantic elements. I have also used axios to verify the credentials for login. The major takeaway from this lecture is using axios for api calling and handling error.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 03</h3>
<p>This lecture delives into intermediate react by adding protected routes and role based authentication. In this lecture I have also used react context api to save the auth state.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 04</h3>
<p>This lecture is a bit advanced react lecture where first I have used local storage to save JWT access token and then Axios Interceptors to send token to backend in each api call. The takeaway from this lecture is how to use local storage for login and how to use axios interceptors.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 05</h3>
<p>In this lecture I have learnt about how to persist the login state so that after login on refreshing page I don't get back to login page. Once, I am logged in I should remain logged in untill I explicitly log out.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 06</h3>
<p>In this lecture I have created some hooks to input data, use local storage and toggle persistant state.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 07</h3>
<p>This lecture helped me to learn the best practices for secure login and alternatives of local storage to save login data. In this lecture I have also learned about how to break and use JWT token to get the required information so that storing login information in state or local storage can be avoided.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 08</h3>
<p>This is wholesome lecture to learn about the login  authentication using Redux toolkit. This lecture has a hint of RTK query also which takes this project to advance level.</p>

<h3>LECTURE 09</h3>
<p>This is the basic lecture where I learnt about how to use authO for SPA's.</p>
